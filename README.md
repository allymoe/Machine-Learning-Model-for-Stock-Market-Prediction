# Machine-Learning-Model-for-Stock-Market-Prediction
## Overview

This project explores the development of **machine learning models** for predicting stock market trends. By analyzing 20 years of historical stock data from Yahoo Finance, this project demonstrates how predictive models like **Linear Regression** and **Long Short-Term Memory Networks (LSTM)** can provide insights into stock price trends.

The focus is on understanding the application of **neural networks** and other machine learning techniques to stock market data, with an emphasis on accuracy and reliability.

## Features

- **Data Collection**: Historical stock data sourced from Yahoo Finance.  
- **Data Preprocessing**: Includes handling missing values and normalizing data for better model performance.  
- **Machine Learning Models**:
  - **Linear Regression** for baseline predictions.
  - **LSTM Networks** for capturing sequential patterns.  
- **Evaluation**: Performance metrics such as **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)** used for model assessment.  
- **Methodology**: Project managed using an adapted **Scrum methodology**, with iterative sprints for solo development.

## Results

- The **Linear Regression model** provides a baseline but struggles with capturing complex patterns in stock prices.  
- The **LSTM model** demonstrates better performance, leveraging historical data trends and patterns.  
- RMSE values highlight the effectiveness of the LSTM model in comparison to traditional approaches.
